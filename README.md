# javascript sessionStorage shopping cart
A complete shopping cart built with Javascript and sessionStorage. Includes PayPal payments.
I wrote this shopping cart script after Gabriele Romanato's tutorial on Smashing Magazine. All credit goes to him for it's design and concepts. His tutorial however, used JQuery. I wanted to rewrite it in vanilla Javascript. You can find his tutorial below:

Gabriele Romanato's tutorial focused on the proof-of-concept of a shopping cart using sessionStorage to store data while retaining the ability to navigate to different pages. It did not focus on form validation. While validation is welcome, trying to cover all the aspects and security risks defeats the purpose of his tutorial.
